In this Appendix, we identify specific areas where effort is needed to 
prepare for LSST science. 
Tasks are categorized
as (1) {\it techniques algorithms, techniques, or software}, (2) {\it
precursor observations or synergy with other facilities}, (3) 
{\it LSST-targeted theory or simulations} and (4) {\it Databases, science queries and data services}. 
For convenience in preparing the Appendix, these are divided by science
topic along the science collaboration boundaries. 
The lists in this Appendix were synthesised and consolidated in the roadmap in chapter \ref{ch:roadmap}.
