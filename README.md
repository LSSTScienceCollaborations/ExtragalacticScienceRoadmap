# LSST Extragalactic Science Roadmap

Planning the investigation of dark matter, galaxies, and black holes with LSST.

The Galaxies, AGN, Supernovae, Weak Lensing and Strong Lensing Science Collaborations are writing a white paper outlining the key extragalactic astronomy analyses that we anticipate carrying out in the 2020s, and working through what needs to be done between now and then to prepare for it.
