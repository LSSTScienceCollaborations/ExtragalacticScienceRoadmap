\section{Galaxy Evolution Task Lists}\label{sec:tasks:gal:intro}  

The LSST design, and to a certain extent the design of the data-management
system, is optimized to carry out the core science mission. For measurements
of dark-energy, that generally means treating galaxies as "tracer particles" --
using statistical measures of ellipticity and position provide statistical
constraints on large-scale structure and cosmic geometry. While many of the
DESC tasks are directly relevant to studying galaxy evolution, they are 
incomplete. In particular, studies of galaxy evolution require more attention to 
optimizing multi-wavelength supporting data, different kinds of spectroscopy, different
kinds of simulations and theoretical support, and greater attention to detection
and characterization of low-surface brightness features or unusual morphologies.

The task list presented here highlights the preparation work needed in the next 3-4
years. Of primary importance are tasks that might influence the detailed survey
design or the algorithms used in the DM to construct catalogs. These are the most
urgent. Also included are activities that can be reasonably independent of the
LSST survey design and DM optimization, but which will ensure good support for
LSST galaxy studies.  

\subsection{Techniques, Algorithms, or Software Development} \label{sec:tasks:gal:precursor}

\begin{tasklist}{T}
\tasktitle{Techniques for finding low-surface-brightness features or galaxies}
% Tidal streams
% Intracluster diffuse light
\begin{task}
\label{task:gal:lsb}
\motivation{
A huge benefit of LSST relative to prior large-area surveys will be its ability to detect 
low-surface-brightness (LSB) features associated with galaxies. This includes tidal streams and
other features associated with past and ongoing mergers, it includes intra-cluster and
intra-group light, and it includes relatively nearby, extended low-surface-brightness galaxies. 
Prior to LSST, typical studies of the low-surface-brightness universe have focused
on relatively small samples, often selected by criteria that are difficult to quantify
or reproduce in theoretical models. Measurements of the LSB features themselves themselves
are challenging, often requiring hand-tuning and interactive scientific judgment. This is
important for accurately quantifying what we observe, but such interactive tuning
of the measurements (a) is not something that can be applied on the LSST scale and (b) 
is difficult to apply to theoretical models. For LSST it is crucial that we automate 
the detection and characterization of LSB features, at least to the point where samples
for further study can be selected via database queries, and where the completeness of
samples returned from such queries can be quantified.
}

\activities{
Several activities are of crucial importance: (1) simulating realistic LSB features, (2) 
using the simulations to optimize detection and measurement, (3) ensuring that LSST
level-2 processing strategies and observing strategies are at least cognizant
of needs of LSB science and (4) developing a strategy for finding and measuring LSB features through
some combination of level 2 measurements, database queries, and level 3 processing.\\
It is important to insert realistic low-surface-brightness
features into LSST simulated images and try to extract and measure them, exploring
different techniques or algorithms for doing the detection and measurement. Because the LSB objects
are sparse on the sky, making realistic LSST sky images is probably not the most efficient
way to accomplish this; more targeted simulations with a higher density of 
LSB objects are needed. The simulated observations need to be realistic in their
treatment of scattered light, particularly scattering from bright stars which
may or may not be in the actual field of view of the telescope. 
Scattering from bright stars is likely to be the primary source of contamination 
when searching for extended LSB features. Ideally, the LSST scattered-light model,
tuned by repeated observations, will be sufficiently good that these contaminants
can be removed or at least flagged at level 2. Defining the metrics for ``sufficiently good,''
based on analysis of simulations, is an important activity that needs early work to 
help inform LSST development. Including Galactic cirrus in the simulations is important
for very large-scale LSB features. Including a cirrus model as part of the LSST background
estimation is worth considering, but it is unclear yet whether the science benefit
can justify the extra effort.  \\
Because the LSST source extraction is primarily
optimized for finding faint, barely-resolved galaxies, it is going to be challenging to
optimize simultaneously for finding large LSB structures and cataloging them as 
one entity in the database. For very large structures, analysis of the LSST ``sky background''
map, might be the most productive approach. We need to work with the LSST project
to make sure the background map is stored in a useful form, and that background
measurements from repeated observations can be combined to separate the fluctuating
foreground and scattered light from the astrophysically interesting signal from extended
LSB structures.  Then, we need strategies for measuring these background maps, characterizing
structures, and developing value-added catalogs to supplement the level 2 database.\\
For smaller structures, it is likely that the database will contain pieces 
of the structure, either as portions of a hierachical
family of deblended objects, or cataloged as separate objects. Therefore, we need to 
develop strategies for querying the database to find such structures and either extract
the appropriate data for customized processing, or develop ways to put back together
the separate entries in the database. A possible value-added catalog, for example, from
the galaxies collaboration might be an extra set of fields for the database to indicate 
which separate objects are probably part of the same physical entity. This would
be sparsely populated in the first year or two of LSST, but by the end of the survey 
could be a useful resource for a wide variety of investigations.

\tasktitle{Techniques for identifying and deblending overlapping galaxies}
\begin{task}
\label{task:gal:XXX}
\motivation{
The Level 2 data products are the most relevant starting point
for galaxy-evolution science. In the LSST nomenclature, {\tt Objects}
represent astrophysical entities (stars, galaxies, quasars, etc.), while
{\tt Sources} represent their single-epoch observations. 
The master list of Objects in Level 2 will be generated by associating
and deblending the list of single-epoch source detections and the
lists of sources detected on coadds. The exact strategies for doing
this are still under active development by the LSST project, and 
engagement with the science community is essential. While each
data release will have unique object IDs, it will be a huge impediment
for LSST science if the first few generations of catalogs turn out
severely the limit the science that can be done via database queries. \\
For galaxies science, the issue of deblending is of critical importance. 
For example, searches for high-redshift galaxies via color selection 
or photometric redshifts involve model or template spectra that make
the prior assumption that the object in question is a single object at
one redshift, not a blend of two objects at two different redshifts.
Therefore to get a reliable estimate of the evolution of classes of galaxies
over redshift, we need to (a) have reasonably clean catalogs to start with
and (b) be able to model the effects of blending on the sample selection
and derivation of redshift and other parameters.  This is critical
not just for galaxy-evolution science, but for lensing and large-scale
structure studies. This is just one example. Another is the evolution
of galaxy morphologies, where the effects of blending and confusion 
may well be the dominant source of uncertainty. \\
The plan for the level-2 catalogs is that sources are hierarchically
deblended and that this hierarchy is maintained in the catalog.
Scientifically important decisions are still to be made about whether
and how to use color information in the deblending, and how to divide
the flux between overlapping components. Even if the Project is doing
the development work, engagement with the community is important for
developing tests and figures of merit to optimize the science return.
}
\activities{
Preparations for LSST in this area involve working both with simulations
and real data. The current LSST image simulations already have realistic source densities,
redshift distributions, sizes, and color distributions. However, the
input galaxies do not have realistic morphologies. At least some simulations
with realistic morphologies are needed, especially for the Deep Drilling Fields. 
Inputs should come both from hydrodynamical simulations (where ``truth'' is known),
{\it Hubble} images, and images from precursor surveys such as CFHTLS, DES and HyperSuprimeCam.
The science collaborations should help provide and vet inputs. \\
More challenging is to come up with techniques and algorithms to improve the
deblending. When two galaxies at different redshifts overlap, using observations
from all the LSST filters and perhaps even EUCLID and WFIRST might 
help to disentangle them. Some attempts have been made over the past few years
to incorporate color information into the deblending algorithm, but this needs
much more attention, not only for developing and testing algorithms, but for
deciding on figures-of-merit for their performance.

\deliverables{

\begin{enumerate}
\item providing realistic galaxy image inputs to the ImSim team;
\item developing tests and figures of meerit to quantify the effects on several science objectives;
\item assessing the current baseline plan for level-2 deblending and for parameter estimation for blended objects;  and 
\item developing prototype implementations of deblending algorithms that take advantage of the LSST color information
