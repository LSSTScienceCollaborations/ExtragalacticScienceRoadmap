The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will enable revolutionary studies of
galaxies, dark matter, and black holes over cosmic time. The
LSST Galaxies Science Collaboration (LSST GSC) has identified a host of preparatory research tasks required 
to leverage fully the LSST dataset for extragalactic science beyond the study of dark energy.
This {\it Galaxies Science Roadmap} provides a brief introduction to critical extragalactic science to be conducted ahead of LSST operations, and a detailed list of preparatory science tasks including the motivation, activities, and deliverables associated with each. The {\it Galaxies Science Roadmap} will serve as a guiding document for researchers interested in conducting extragalactic science in anticipation of the forthcoming LSST era.
